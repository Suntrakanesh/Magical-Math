# Magical-Math
It can performe the magic using simple mathematical technique and I have included C graphics functions for better experiance. It usually ask the player to assume any three digit number and the last digit must be lesser than first digit. Then, we need to reverse the assumed number (Eg. if the assumed number is 541, then the reversed number is 145 ). Subsequently, we need to subtract the reversed number from assumed number. Then, it will prompt you to enter the last digit of the subtracted answer. Once you entered it, it will show the entire subtracted answer. It finds the answer without the operands as well as using single digit. That's the beauty in it. So that, it named as "Magical Math".
